The `infomeasure` package has been made public: a comprehensive Python package for information theory measures and estimators.
Find it on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/infomeasure/), [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/infomeasure) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15241810).
The extensive documentation also has a [Reference Guide](https://infomeasure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/#reference-guide) with the theoretical background.
