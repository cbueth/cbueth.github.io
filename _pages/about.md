Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at <a href='https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/en/'>IFISC 
(CSIC-UIB)</a> in Palma de Mallorca, Spain.
Originally specialized in Nonlinear Physics, Complex Systems and Quantum Field Theory,
I am interested in the study of transport, especially active mobility modes, and 
sustainability.

As I studied both Physics and Computer Science, my methods are mostly computational.
My undergrad theses were on <i>Deep Inelastic $$e^Â±p$$ Scattering with Boson Exchange 
and Interference</i>, then <i>Fault Injection for Robustness Testing of Satellite 
On-Board Image Processing</i> (at <a href='https://www.dlr.de/en/'>the German Aerospace
Center</a>), and finally <i>Analyzing the Network Effects of Computationally 
Generated Low Traffic Neighborhoods</i> (at <a href='https://nerds.itu.dk/'>NERDS,
ITU Copenhagen</a>).

Inbetween, I interned at the <a href='https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/'>Faculty of
Technology, Policy and Management</a> at <a href='https://www.tudelft.nl/en/'>
TU Delft, The Netherlands</a>, to gain experience in the field of active mobility
and transport safety.

As of now, I am assisting with a research project at
<a href='https://plus.ethz.ch/'>PLUS (ETH Zurich)</a> in context of
<a href='https://www.valpar.ch/index_en.php?page=home_en'>ValPar.ch</a>, exploring 
the impact of future climate scenarios on biodiversity and ecosystem services in
Switzerland.
